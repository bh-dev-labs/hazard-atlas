# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Attribution links to the repository instead of publishing an email address, and states that the project is independent of the University of Toronto and the USGS.
- The release string is single-sourced from `package.json` and reaches Go through `-ldflags`; an unflagged build reports `dev`.
- Colour moved to CSS custom properties with a dark theme, and depth now uses one sequential light-to-dark ramp instead of three unrelated hues.
- Event table sorts from its column headers with `aria-sort`, across five columns in both directions.
- The globe accepts the keyboard: arrows rotate, +/- zoom, N steps through visible markers, Enter opens one, and each landing is announced.
- Charts bin time by the loaded span (hourly, six-hourly or daily), trim empty magnitude bins, and draw real axes scaled to the data.
- Interface split into memoised components so rotation no longer re-renders the table and charts sixty times a second.
- Fixed the region preset whose displayed option cleared the region it named.
- Fixed list reconciliation: keyed rows no longer mispair selection state when sorting or paging.
- Stopping the server moved out of the reference links; felt-report fields collapse to one sentence when nothing was reported.
- Saving a 20,000-event dataset is about 38% faster through prepared statements; the response cache evicts its oldest entry rather than an arbitrary one.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-06 UTC)

- Initial local Earthquake Observatory application and offline USGS snapshot.
